The ForgeLanguage project is a programming language with a compiler centered on pattern matching.

Users of the software are programmers who want to write code for any reason, or those interested in programming language creation.
The plan is to create a tool which trivializes pattern matching, this tool will most likely be either a finite state machine or higher classification of automata theory.

The unique pattern matching approach to creating the compiler may yeild a language which has features seldom found in other main stream languages.
